Research Assistant at Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) advised by <a href='https://fmiranda.me/'>Dr. Fabio Miranda</a>.

My research leverages skills in <span style="background-color: rgba(2,118,223, 0.2); color: #0276DF; padding: 2px 2px; border-radius: 3px;">visualization & visual analytics</span>, <span style="background-color: rgba(2,118,223, 0.2); color: #0276DF; padding: 2px 2px; border-radius: 3px;">big data analysis</span>, and <span style="background-color: rgba(2,118,223, 0.2); color: #0276DF; padding: 2px 2px; border-radius: 3px;">applied machine learning</span>. Specifically, I focus on utilizing these skills within urban planning and health informatics, aiming to enhance the ability of domain experts to efficiently analyze large-scale data and uncover complex patterns through advanced visual analytics systems. My work also involves open-sourcing projects to foster further research in these areas, that include:
(1) <a href="https://github.com/komar41/vigma">VIGMA</a>, a comprehensive system for gait data processing, analysis, and visualization, and (2) <a href='https://github.com/uic-evl/deep-umbra'>Deep Umbra</a>, an accumulated shadow computation technique along with visual analytics system and shadow dataset for over 100 cities.

Outside of my academic work, I enjoy playing guitar, listening to music, and a little bit of reading. I also love watching series and movies, as well as traveling, although I've had fewer opportunities to travel lately. Recently, I've developed a growing interest in board games.
