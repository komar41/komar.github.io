          contents:
            - "<small>Developed a prediction model to detect autism spectrum disorder (ASD) for different age groups using a merged random forest (CART and ID3) classifier. The model could effectively predict autistic traits for all three age groups and was later deployed in a mobile application.</small>"

    #     description:
    #       - "Investigated coverage of OpenStreetMap (OSM) sidewalk data and computed the trustworthiness index as an alternative measure to assess the quality of the data. Our study takes a step toward understanding OSM sidewalk data quality by evaluating its coverage and reliability."
    #       - "Developed a novel computational framework based on a conditional generative adversarial neural network that enables the quantification of sunlight access and shadows at a global scale."
    #       - "Developed an in-memory model to approximate spatiotemporal mobility-flow queries based on NeuralCubes - a neural network model for learning query-result approximation."
