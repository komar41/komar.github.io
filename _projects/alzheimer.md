`Abstract`

<p align='justify'>
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that causes to develop dementia. Alzheimer's patients find it hard to remember recent events, reason and even to recognize people they know. As the disease advances, symptoms can include difficulty with language, disorientation including getting lost, mood swings, loss of motivation, lack of self-awareness and overall behavior. Though a limited number of IT based solutions exist to provide support for Alzheimer's patients, but most of these provide very isolated services either for the patients or for the caregivers. The objective of this research is to propose an assistive tool for Alzheimer's patients and their caregivers to provide support like health monitoring, assist to find lost items, provide reminder to take medicine and assist to monitor patient's location. A light-weighted evaluation study was carried out with 15 participants. The evaluation study showed that the proposed system was effective and usable for the patients and their caregivers.
